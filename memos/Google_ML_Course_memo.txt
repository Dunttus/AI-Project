** Introduction to ML 5min **
You can make programs that you have no idea how to code by your self like face recognize.
You can save time by not making 10s of thousands of lines of code of how to recongnize speech

COMPARED TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING
Coding by hand: Logically and mathemically
Machine learning: Focus shifts from mathemical science to natural science

** Framing 15min & Descending into ML 20min **
LABELS, FEATURE AND MODEL
Task of is email message spam or not spam?
E-mail label = Spam/Not Spam			--> Output target
E-mail feature = "From to user"			--> Data that helps ML decide
E-mail model = "from to user" + "Header"	--> prediction output

MSE = Mean Squared Error = Calculated Error rate for machine learning

** REDUCING LOSS 60min **
Loss vs. Weight meter goes over data curve and takes step back.

A Machine Learning model is trained by starting with an initial guess for the weights and bias and iteratively adjusting 
those guesses until learning the weights and bias with the lowest possible loss.

gradiant decent in TensorFlow handles all the gradient computations automaticly for you, so you don't actually have to 
understand the calculus provided in Googles ml crash course.
